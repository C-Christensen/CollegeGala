# CollegeGala
Created a searchable and sortable database of people attending a college gala using Java.

Built a system that stores the employee and visitor data with the following criteria: (a) duplicates (identical) records are not allowed, (b) records should be stored in a way so that they can be "filtered" into specific batches of data, and (c) the primary option for reorganizing the data should be searching by last name for employees and arrival time for visitors, however there should be some flexibility to rearrange by other criteria as well For employee records, the order of precedence for searching through each batch should be by last name, first name, years of service, salary, then age, etc. Visitor records should start by order of arrival time, last name, then first name, etc.
